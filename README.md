MATLAB Tool used for data analysis using random variables (randVar object) as an abstract object to simulate non-deterministic entities 
for data modelling. Originally developed during UTH CAS-LAB summer internship for the purpose of statistical timing analysis of circuits
where random impurities in transistor production affect timing analysis.

See power point for more info.

Requires some MATLAB statistics / machine learning / signal processing packages to run, but im working on getting rid of that.
