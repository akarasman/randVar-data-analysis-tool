MATLAB Tool used for data analysis using random variables (randVar object) as an abstract object to simulate non-deterministic entities 
for data modelling. Originally developed during UTH CAS-LAB summer internship for the purpose of statistical timing analysis of circuits
where random impurities in transistor production affect timing analysis.

See ppt for more info. Test cases folder contains some useful examples

Requires some MATLAB statistics / machine learning / signal processing packages to run, but im working on getting rid of that.
